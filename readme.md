# Project Setup and API Information

Welcome to the project! This repository contains a frontend and two backend services: an **Inventory Service** and a **Supplier Service**.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps for each folder: `web`, `api`, and `supplier api`.

1.  **Open a new terminal** for each service.
2.  Navigate to the directory of the service you want to start (e.g., `cd web`).
3.  Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the servers in each folder web, api and supplierapi with this command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5.  Once all services are running, you can access the frontend user interface at:
    `http://localhost:3000/`
